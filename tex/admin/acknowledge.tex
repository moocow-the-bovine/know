Many thanks to, in no particular order:

Ed, Paul, and Pete, for persisting through a flux of possible rules
and discussions of the epistemological and ontological apparatus
these implied.

Dan, for the Significant Errand and for the sheer staying power
required to prove that the Solipsistic Path is in fact sometimes
the only alternative to stasis.

Jay, Jessica, Unga, and all other play testers, for working out
the kinks.
